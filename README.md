This C++ program enables users to interact with a clock display, offering options to add time units and displaying both 12-hour and 24-hour formats. The code excels in its modular design and readability. The code could be enhanced in several ways to improve efficiency, security, and maintainability. For efficiency, one improvement could be to use more optimized algorithms for handling time calculations, especially when adding seconds, minutes, or hours. Additionally, error handling and input validation could be added to handle invalid user input, ensuring the program does not crash or produce unexpected results. Overcoming challenges involved understanding the manipulation of the tm structure. Valuable skills acquired from this project include modular programming and time manipulation. Overcoming this challenge could involve consulting relevant documentation and resources, such as the C++ reference materials or tutorials that cover working with dates and times in C++. By incorporating these resources into the support network, one can gain a better understanding of time manipulation techniques and develop a more solid foundation in programming. The program is maintainable, readable, and adaptable due to its modular structure and clear variable naming conventions.
